**Architecture: Clean Architecture**

**Overview**

This document outlines the architecture of the Flutter blog app, following the clean architecture principles for separation of concerns and maintainability.

**Core Layers**

- **Domain Layer:**
    - Represents the core business logic of the application, independent of any UI or data persistence concerns.
    - Contains entities, use cases, and repositories.
    - **Entities:** Model blog posts and user data (if applicable).
    - **Use Cases:** Define core functionalities like creating, fetching, and updating blog posts.
    - **Repositories:** Abstracts data access logic, allowing decoupling from specific storage mechanisms (e.g., local database, remote API).
- **Data Layer:**
    - Responsible for data persistence and retrieval.
    - Implements the repositories defined in the domain layer.
    - May use a local database solution like Hive or a remote API depending on requirements.
    - Adheres to the repository interface for seamless replacement with different data sources.
- **Presentation Layer:**
    - Handles the UI logic and user interactions.
    - Utilizes the use cases from the domain layer for data manipulation.
    - May consist of widgets and state management solutions like BLoC or Provider.
    - Presents blog posts and allows user interactions (if applicable).

**Benefits of Clean Architecture**

- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns facilitates independent development, testing, and modification of each layer.
- **Testability:** Easier to write unit tests for domain logic and integration tests for data interactions.
- **Flexibility:** Adaptable to different UI frameworks and data storage solutions using interfaces and abstractions.
- **Reusability:** Domain logic can be shared across different applications.

**Additional Considerations**

- **State Management:** Choose a state management solution that aligns with your project's complexity and preferences (e.g., BLoC, Provider, Riverpod).
- **Data Access:** Select the appropriate data storage mechanism based on requirements (local database, remote API, or a combination).
- **Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for each layer for robust development.
- **Dependency Injection:** Consider a dependency injection pattern to manage dependencies between layers for better code organization and testability.
